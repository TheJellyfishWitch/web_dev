		<h1>Deep Sea Creatures</h1>
		<h2>What makes the creatures of the deep sea so interesting?</h2>
		<p>Deep sea creatures are fascinating because of their unique adaptations to extreme conditions like crushing pressure, total darkness, and scarce food. These adaptations include <em>bioluminescence</em> for hunting and communication, <em>transparent or red-colored bodies</em>  for camouflage, <em>large eyes</em>  to capture faint light, and other features like <em>massive mouths</em>, <em>sharp teeth</em>, or <em>flexible bodies</em>  to survive in this harsh environment.</p>

		<h3>Some of my favorite of these creatures include:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Barreleye fish (<em>Macropinna microstoma</em>)</li>
			<li>The Dragonfish (<em>family Stomiidae</em>)</li>
			<li>The Moon jelly (<em>Aurelia aurita</em>)</li>
			<li>The Silky jelly (<em>Colobonema sericeum</em>)</li>
			<li>The Vampire squid (<em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 style="text-align: center;">But my favorite of these magical creatures is tied between the Deep-sea Crown jelly & the Giant Phantom jelly</h3>

		<h2>The Deep-sea Crown Jelly</h2>
		<p>The Deep-sea Crown jelly (<em>Atolla spp.</em>) is one of the most common jellies in the ocean's depths. Most have a distinctive elongated tentacle that can be up to six times the diameter of the jelly's bell. Scientists suspect that characteristic trailing tentacle helps this jelly capture food. Predators lurk in the darkness, ready to pounce. The bright red bell helps keep Atolla hidden—in the deep sea, red appears black. If Atolla's crimson camouflage does not work, this jelly sounds the alarm with pinwheels of brilliant blue bioluminescence. A burst of light in the dark water not only disorients predators but it also acts like a burglar alarm telling larger predators there is something interesting happening here. The threat of a bigger predator scares off any immediate danger, allowing the jelly to swim to safety.</p>
		<p>Reaches around 6 inches at mzximum size and typically in the midnight (bathypelagic) zone from 500-5,000 feet down. Its diet mainly constists with plankton and gelatinous zooplankton and crustaceans, lives worldwide.</p>

		<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Habitat:</b> Midwater, typically in the midnight (bathypelagic) zone</li>
			<li><b>Unique tentacle:</b> They have a very long, single tentacle, used to ensare small prey as they swim</li>
			<li><b>Crown-like shape:</b> The "crown" refers to a deep groove that runs around the umbrella-like bell, distinguishing them from other jellyfish.</li>
			<li><b>Red Color:</b> Their natural scarlet color is a form of camouflage in the deep sea, as red light does not penetrate to those depths.</li>

		<h2>The Deep-sea Phantom Jelly</h2>
		<p>The Deep-sea Phantom jelly (<em>Stygiomedusa gigantea</em>) the first specimen of the giant phantom jelly was collected in 1899, but it was not until 60 years later that scientists recognized this as a new species. Even now, scientists still know very little about this animal. The bell of this deep-sea denizen is more than one meter (3.3 feet) across and trails four ribbon-like oral (or mouth) arms that can grow to more than 10 meters (33 feet) in length. Reasurchers at MBARI have logged thousands of dives, yet they've only seen this spectacular species nine times.</p>
		<p>Maximum size is over 3.3 feet across and 33 feet long. Lives between the surface and 22,000 feet down, typically in the midnight (bathypelagic) zone. The giatn phantom jelly eats presumably, plankton and small fishes and lives worldwide except for the Arctic Ocean.</p>

		<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Unique reproduction:</b> Unlike most other jellyfish, it is viviparous, meaning it gives birth to live young.</li>
			<li><b>Rarely seen:</b> Fewer than 150 times since its discovery in 1899. While some sources cite a specific number around 115-130 sightings, the total is very low due to the creature's deep-sea habitat and rarity. </li>
			<li><b>No stingers:</b> This elusive jellyfish also uses its ribbon-like arms, not stinging tentacles, to grab prey like small fish and plankton. </li>
			<li><b>Color & Glow:</b> The jelly is reddish-orange when visible light is present, but in the deep ocean, it can appear "invisible" or have a faint, reddish glow due to bioluminescence, which may help it communicate, attract prey, or confuse predators.</li>
			<li><b>Symbiotic relationship:</b>  It has a symbiotic relationship with a small fish called the pelagic brotula, which has been observed swimming among its arms. </li>
