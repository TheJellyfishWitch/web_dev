		<h1>Deep Sea Creatures</h1>
		<h2>What makes the creatures of the deep sea so interesting?</h2>
		<p>Deep sea creatures are fascinating because of their unique adaptations to extreme conditions like crushing pressure, total darkness, and scarce food. These adaptations include <em>bioluminescence</em> for hunting and communication, <em>transparent or red-colored bodies</em>  for camouflage, <em>large eyes</em>  to capture faint light, and other features like <em>massive mouths</em>, <em>sharp teeth</em>, or <em>flexible bodies</em>  to survive in this harsh environment.</p>

		<h3>Some of my favorite of these creatures include:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Barreleye fish (<em>Macropinna microstoma</em>)
			<li>The Dragonfish (<em>family Stomiidae</em>)
			<li>The Moon jelly (<em>Aurelia aurita</em>)
			<li>The Silky jelly (<em>Colobonema sericeum</em>)
			<li>The Vampire squid (<em>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</em>)
		</ul>

		<h3>But my favorite of these magical creatures is tied between the Deep-sea Crown jelly & the Giant Phantom jelly</h3>

		<h2>The Deep-sea Crown Jelly</h2>
		<p>The Deep-sea Crown jelly (<em>Atolla spp.</em>) is one of the most common jellies in the ocean's depths. Most have a distinctive elongated tentacle that can be up to six times the diameter of the jelly's bell. Scientists suspect that characteristic trailing tentacle helps this jelly capture food. Predators lurk in the darkness, ready to pounce. The bright red bell helps keep Atolla hidden—in the deep sea, red appears black. If Atolla's crimson camouflage does not work, this jelly sounds the alarm with pinwheels of brilliant blue bioluminescence. A burst of light in the dark water not only disorients predators but it also acts like a burglar alarm telling larger predators there is something interesting happening here. The threat of a bigger predator scares off any immediate danger, allowing the jelly to swim to safety.</p>

		<h2>The Deep-sea Phantom Jelly</h2>
		<p>The Deep-sea Phantom jelly (<em>Stygiomedusa gigantea</em>) the first specimen of the giant phantom jelly was collected in 1899, but it was not until 60 years later that scientists recognized this as a new species. Even now, scientists still know very little about this animal. The bell of this deep-sea denizen is more than one meter (3.3 feet) across and trails four ribbon-like oral (or mouth) arms that can grow to more than 10 meters (33 feet) in length. Reasurchers at MBARI have logged thousands of dives, yet they've only seen this spectacular species nine times.</p>
